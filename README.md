There have been various methods for installing activity LEDs in your Xbox, and this mod makes it very simple to do so. Really, all you need to do is solder the 6 wires provided to the points shown in the digram and run the wires as you so desire. You can place your front panel LEDs anywhere on the console you like, but I prefer to place them under the right side of the front panel.
